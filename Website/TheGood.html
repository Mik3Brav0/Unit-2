            As you can see Malakai is a very cute cat. He has a lovely loud purr and
            likes his tummy being touched/combed.
        <p>
            He is also quite good at coming to you when you call his name, unless he's
            intent on hunting some mouse or bird outside.
        <p>
            It's nice that he will willingly jump on my lap if I'm sat down and will
            stay on it for a while, whether or not i'm giving him attention.
