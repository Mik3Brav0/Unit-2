    <h1>Things aren't always so easy</h1>

    <br />

    <p>Malakai is a <strong>very</strong> talkative cat. The only time he doesn't talk to us is when he is
    eating, sleeping, being given constant attention or is out of the building.</p>

    <p>I won't deny it's cute sometimes, we often say meow back after he does and then it's as if he is
    responding.
    <p>That being said, he is always meowing whenever one of us is in our small kitchen, or if he wants to 
        get out of the flat (he really enjoys the outdoors).
    <p>Despite having food at exactly the same time every day (we use an auto-feeder) he also starts meowing 
    around 30 mins in advance of mealtime.
    <p>We've not regretted getting what we've named as 'Albert' since filling it/him up and turning it/him 
    on.
    <p>Albert is made by a company called <em>Athorbot</em>. It's reservoir we've worked out holds a full month
    of food.
    <p>This is despite it dispensing about 16gs of food 4 times every day. We think it's great.
